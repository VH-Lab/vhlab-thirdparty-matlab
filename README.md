# vhlab_thirdparty
A distribution of 3rd party open source software tools that is used by VH Lab

It is our intention to redistribute only software that is open source, with an accompaning license or author citation. Many of these tools are from the Matlab File Exchange, but others are independent software projects released under open source licenses.

They are bundled here to facilitate installation on VH Lab computers, because our toolboxes, libraries, and apps depend on routines or applications included here.
