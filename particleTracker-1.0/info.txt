Using detection part from plusTipTracker, since it only takes the bit depth as input and 
can account for particles of different sizes and intensity.
The tracking part of of that program is tailored to the dynamics of microtubule growth, 
so it's not apropriate in my case. For that reason I'm using the latest version of u-track 
to do the tracking.
